		My Corona diary
		</h2>

		Coping with the whole idea of a lockdown hasn't been easy. Boredom was at its peak so I had to find new activities to occupy myself with. The following some of the activities I occupied myself with.

					Listening to Podcasts
				</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: midnightblue; ">
					Listening to Podcasts became a new thing I couldn't do away with during the lockdown. It replaced radio for me. It was very informative, entertaining and refreshing since it wasnt like the normal radio programs i was used to . I really hope to continue with it now that  the lockdown is over but we are still observing the precautionary guideline available. These are some of my favorite podcasts channel and I hope you would try them out.

					Learning how to Cook
				</h4>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; color: midnightblue; ">
					Before the corona lockdown days I wouldn't have accepted any cooking challenge with anyone, so this whole lockdown period served me with the oppurtunity to learn how to cook. I can't call myself a world class chef now but I can cook indomie and rice with some flex on you. The point is I learnt how to cook one or two simple dishes that might be handy in the coming days.
